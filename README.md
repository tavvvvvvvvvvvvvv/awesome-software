# <p align="center"> awesome software

A curated collection of useful software for Windows 10 and 11, from multimedia tools to utilities that make your everyday computing experience better. I personally use a majority of these applications and recommend them highly. All of these software(s) are safe to use, open source (for the most part) and don't require any heavy techonological setup.
